CubesViewer - OLAP Visual Viewer and Explore Tool
=================================================

About
-----

CubesViewer is a visual, web-based tool application for exploring and analyzing
OLAP databases served by the Cubes OLAP Framework.

This tool allows users to inspect the different dimensions, measures and
aggregated data in different ways, allowing you to build tables and charts
based on analytical data available from the server.  

CubesViewer is a visual interface for the 
open-source ["Cubes" server](http://databrewery.org/cubes.html) (an OLAP server in Python). 
Purpose is to keep it simple and modular, leveraging the web services 
provided by Cubes.  

The main focus of CubesViewer is the full GUI application 
for CubesViewer views creation and management.
But CubesViewer is mainly an HTML5 application which can also be embedded
completely or partially in other sites. Views can easily be 
inserted on other web pages.

Features:

* User Interface allowing for multiple views on-screen. 
* Cube explorer providing drilldown and cut operations.
* Supports dimension hierarchies and date filtering.
* Several charts and diagrams.
* Multi-user.
* View management, sharing and saving.
* Shared notes system to annotate cubes and views.
* Views can be embedded in other web sites.
* Modular and extensible.
